*Steps to execute:* 

1. From the shell script - 

`bash island_in_water.sh islands.txt`


2. From the terminal - 

`python3 island_in_water.py islands.txt`



PS: I have written the Dockerfile as well to build the container and execute but would recommend executing from the shell script or the python script.
